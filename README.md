# pui-s22-FoodStory
A subscription and purchase website for health foods.

## Home / Products Overview Page
The home page also functions as a product overview page. It has a minimalist design that displays the top 3 items for each food category, and the users can view more items by clicking on the left and right arrows.
The user could access the product detail pages by clicking on the product images or titles.

## Product Page
The product page displays the item image, item information (including title and description), and options that the user could select from. 
In the example (drink-1.html) case, the options are flavors.
Users could also select quantity and delivery span before they add the item to their cart.

## Login Page (extra)
This page can be accessed by clicking on the top-right navigation bar. If you haven't logged in before, the action will bring you to the Login page. 
Currently, since we are using a static website, your username and password will not be recorded for information security.
After logging in, you will be redirected to the Account page.

## Account Page (extra)
This page can be accessed by clicking on the top-right navigation bar. If you have already logged in, the action will bring you to the Account page. 
You can view your upcoming subscriptions and all subscriptions on the Dashboard, or change account settings. (This features are not implemented yet for this stage.)
You can also log out on this page. This action will redirect you to the Login page, and you would have to log in again to access your account.

## Cart Page (extra)
This page displays all items you have added to your cart.
You can still change the quantity and delivery span, or delete items, at this stage. Note that removing items will elicit a pop-up windowing warning you of the consequence of the action. (At the current stage, the removal button is only for display. We will implement the functionality in the future.)
After you are happy with your selection, you can click on the Check Out button. This should take you to the Check Out page, but since it is not implemented yet, you will be redirected to your Account page.
